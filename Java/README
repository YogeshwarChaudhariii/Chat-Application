Chat Messenger with Log Facility

Technology: Java Programming

Project Overview:
1) This project is a Java-based peer-to-peer chat application that enables real-time text-based communication
between users using Java Socket Programming.
2) Along with providing basic chat functionality, it also maintains a log file that records all conversation details in a
periodic fashion for future reference.
3) The application is platform and architecture independent, running on any system with a Java Runtime
Environment (JRE).

Key Features:
• Peer-to-Peer Communication
◦ Uses Java sockets for direct communication between clients.
• Real-Time Chat
◦ Enables instant text-based messaging between connected peers.
• Chat Log Maintenance
◦ Logs all chat history with timestamps into a file.
◦ Provides periodic logging for organized record-keeping.
• Cross-Platform
◦ Runs seamlessly across different operating systems and architectures.
• Lightweight & Extensible
◦ Can be extended to support group chat, file sharing, or encryption.

Learning Outcomes:
• Practical knowledge of Java Socket Programming (TCP/IP).
• Hands-on experience with network programming concepts (client-server, peer-to-peer).
• Implementation of logging mechanisms in applications.
• Understanding of platform-independent communication in Java.
• Foundation for building scalable chat/messaging applications.
